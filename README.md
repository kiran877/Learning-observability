# Learning-observability
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey into observability in DevOps. It contains resources, configurations, and examples related to monitoring and analyzing system performance. The goal is to explore how observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack can be used to gain real-time insights into application behavior.
